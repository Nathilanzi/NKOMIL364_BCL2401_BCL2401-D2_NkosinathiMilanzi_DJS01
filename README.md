Debugging Guide Readme

This document provides a guide for debugging and improving the given code. The code calculates new velocity, distance, and remaining fuel based on given parameters.

1. Make the code more readable
Rename variables to be more descriptive and self-explanatory.
Add comments to explain the purpose of each section of code.
Break down long calculations into smaller, more manageable functions.

2. Pick up calculation errors
Validate input parameters to ensure they are of the correct type and unit.
Use type checking to catch errors early.
Consider using a library like units-ts to handle unit conversions and ensure accuracy.

3. Make calculations robust
Throw errors when invalid input is detected, rather than continuing with potentially incorrect calculations.
Consider using a try-catch block to handle errors and provide user-friendly error messages.
